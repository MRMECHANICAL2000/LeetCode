Key :  Look Max consecutive ones part 3, it wont be easy as you think
	   **IMPORTANT**you can see the edge case of for Loop in this question **IMPORTANT**
		dry run the code by "return(overMax)" and "return(max(curMax,overMax))" seperately

		Approach -> Using a variable to store curMax and overMax. compare curMax ,overMax each time and
